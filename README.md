Base62
======

Base62 encoder/decoder for Java.

See [here](https://github.com/dukky/Base62/blob/master/base62/src/im/duk/base62/Base62.java#L95) for example usage.

Supports custom character sets for base62.

This is really just a dummy project that I used to test out some things with git/github and there are probably much better implementations of base62 for java on github already. Feel free to contribute any improvements/ideas though!
